abstract: At EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure), we are
  constantly looking at Digital Tools that can assist in the research of
  Holocaust and refugee related topics. We hope to make these tools as
  accessible as possible so that researchers who have no experience with digital
  tools will consider trying new ways of using their data. A number of datasets
  presented at EHRI related events contain place names that researchers wish to
  present on maps. In order to accurately display locations, latitude and
  longitude coordinates are essential. EHRI has created an entity matching tool
  to help researchers find coordinates for present day locations.

At EHRI, we are constantly looking at Digital Tools that can assist in the research of Holocaust and refugee related topics. We hope to make these tools as accessible as possible so that researchers who have no experience with digital tools will consider trying new ways of using their data.

A number of datasets presented at EHRI related events contain place names that researchers wish to present on maps. In order to accurately display locations, latitude and longitude coordinates are essential. EHRI has created an entity matching tool to help researchers find coordinates for present day locations.

The dataset in this example relates to the birthplaces of a number of refugees who escaped from Nazi occupied Europe to Great Britain and were then deported to Australia.
