abstract: >-
  Archives often have the wish to make their collections searchable and findable
  on a map like Google Maps or Open Street Map. This is a nice interface for
  users on which they can zoom in on a specific geographic location and see what
  collections are linked to it. This promise of a user friendly geographic
  search interface is appealing. But for most archives identifying geographical
  information in their collections and develop services for their users is still
  often in an experimental or first phase. 


  In EHRI knowledge about Named Entity Recognition (NER) is available, as is in many larger European projects or research infrastructures. This technique is used to scan the metadata (or OCR’d archival material) and identify geographic information, but it is also possible to identify persons, organisations, keywords or other specific information units.

In [EHRI](https://ehri-project.eu/) knowledge about Named Entity Recognition (NER) is available, as is in many larger European projects or research infrastructures. This technique is used to scan the metadata (or OCR’d archival material) and identify geographic information, but it is also possible to identify persons, organisations, keywords or other specific information units.

## L﻿earning outcome

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

- Understand how different pieces of information can be identified in archival descriptions and be used to enrich the metadata and the EHRI vocabularies
